## TECH STACK

## FUNCTIONALITY

The functionality is fairly straightforward:

1 - The user data is fetched from the random user API and stored in an array.

2 - The users array is mapped and displayed in a list.

3 - By clicking the show button, it filters the users array by matching the id of the clicked user and returning it in the new filtered user array.

4 - The filtered user array displays with additional information above the list of mapped users.  

## CHALLENGES

This was a fun challenge and gave me an opportunity to do some further learning with arrays.

The main challenge I faced was to return the user that was clicked on. Take a look at the code to see how I managed it.
